# HTML Filter

A web interface to filter HTML using CSS selectors - https://html-filter.netlify.app/

## Motivation

I occasionally find myself wanting to extract parts of a large HTML document so I can repurpose it in some way, so why not build a tool for that.

## Future
I would like to add more functionality to this tool allowing for extracting and wrapping text content from the HTML.
